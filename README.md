A simple 2D checkers game made using a graphics library by John Zelle

Hello! I am a high school senior interested in majoring computer science. I currently take high school and college-level computer science classes, and in my spare time I make small games like this one. Fluent in Python and Java. Prefer back-end to front-end. Will take on web design only if absolutely necessary. Some projects I would eventually like to make are a billiard balls simulation, basic 3D graphics engine, city builder game, and, as it seems to be a rite of passage in the world of programming, Minecraft. Other than programming (obviously), we would probably get along very well if you also happended to like Lord of the Rings or the game of Go.

Thanks for READing ME!
